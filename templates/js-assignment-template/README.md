# JavaScript Assignment Template

Welcome to the LearnHub JavaScript assignment workspace. This template is optimised for StackBlitz and CodeSandbox, and mirrors the workflow students follow inside the LMS.

## Getting Started

1. Click **Open in StackBlitz** (preferred) or **Open in CodeSandbox** from your course assignment page.
2. Authenticate with GitHub in the online editor when prompted.
3. Create a branch using the assignment naming convention:
   ```
   assign/<assignment-slug>/<github-handle>
   ```
4. Complete the tasks described in [`TASKS.md`](TASKS.md) or the assignment brief.
5. Run the automated tests:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
6. Commit your work with meaningful messages and push the branch to your fork.
7. Open a Pull Request (PR) targeting `main` and fill in the PR template checklist.

## Tooling

- **Runtime:** Node 20
- **Tests:** [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)
- **Linting:** ESLint (Standard config)

## Submission

- Ensure **all tests pass** before opening a PR.
- Attach a screenshot and a short self-assessment in the PR template.

Good luck and happy coding! ðŸš€
